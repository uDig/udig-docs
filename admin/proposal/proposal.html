<body>
<p>The User-friendly Desktop Internet GIS (uDig) project is a proposed open source project under the <a
	href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/LocationTech">LocationTech Industry Working Group</a>.</p>

<!-- 
	The communication channel must be specified. Typically, this is the

 -->
<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse
community. Please send all feedback to the 
<a href="https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/location-iwg">LocationTech Discussion</a>
email list.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->

<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->

<p>The scope of uDig is to:</p>

<!-- WTB: "Mapping" seems too generic and meaningless. Perhaps this is because I don't live in the space.
What sorts of things does uDig enable users/adopters to do? -->

<ul>
<li>Provide an Eclipse-based rich client mapping solution for desktop users</li>
<li>Provide an SDK of mapping components for use in Eclipse RCP development</li>
<li>Support mapping with local and external sources of spatial information</li>
</ul>

<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->

<p>uDig is an open source desktop application framework, built with Eclipse Rich Client (RCP) technology. uDig provides
a complete Java solution for desktop GIS data access, editing, and viewing.</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>U</b>ser friendly: familiar graphical environment for GIS users;</li>
	<li><b>D</b>esktop appliation: running as a thick client, natively user interface on Windows, Mac OS/X and Linux</li>
	<li><b>I</b>nternet: supporting standard (WMS, WFS, WCS,KML) and de facto (GeoRSS, tiles) geospatial web services</li>
	<li><b>G</b>IS: framework for spatial data exploration and analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why LocationTech?</h2> 

<!-- 
	What value does this project bring to the LocationTech
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at LocationTech?

 -->
<p>The uDig project brings LocationTech an established Eclipse RCP GIS solution with a strong focus on ease-of-use and
integration.</p>

<p>The uDig project is well known in the spatial software community and is taking this opportunity to join LocationTech as an outreach
to Eclipse RCP developers.</p>

<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->

<p>The project includes "GeoTools" components of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation made available under
an LGPL license. Other noted dependencies are the Java extensions JAI, ImageIO and ImageIO-Ext.</p>

<p>The use of LGPL components has been negotiated with the LocationTech industry working group and
does not represent an issue.</p>

<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

    </dl>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->
<p>The initial contribution will be made by the uDig Project Steering Committee. Code ownership is held
by Refractions Research under the direction of the uDig Project Steering Committee. Additional
"jgrass" plugins made available by HydroloGIS. This is an established development community with world wide representation, drawn from
a number of organisations.</p>

<p>
<b>GIS Platform</b>: provides a local catalog of spatial services, with minimal Dublin Core details
supplemented with a spatial extent. Each listed item implements <b>IResolve</b> operating in a
similar fashion to <b>IAdaptable</b> with the additional expectation of both latency and IOErrors.
Implementations are provided to work with a range of spatial services from popular file formats,
through to spatial databases (such as PostGIS, DB2 and Oracle) and of Open Geospaital 
Consortium web servies (Web Feature Server, Web Map Server).
</p>
<p>
<b>GIS Application</b> provides an EMF model for Project, Map and Layer with an implementation
of <b>MapViewer</b> to facilitate embedding a map component in RCP apps. This forms the core
of the example uDig application we make available to show case the SDK capabilities.
</p>
<p>
Additional contributions cover raster processing and analysis (ie JGrass), printing and integration.
</p>

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mentor 1</li>
	<li>Mentor 2</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Refractions Research</li>
	<li>HydroloGIS</li>
	<li>LISAsoft</li>
	<li>Open Source Geospatial Foundation</li>
	<li>AmanziTel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
 -->
<p>
This is a live project with responsibility to existing development teams, training courses, 
and interaction with downstream projects (such as OSGeo Live DVD). It is our intension to
transition as quickly as possible and promptly issue a release.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Q3 2012: Complete transition to Tycho</li>
<li>Q4 2012: Upgrade to Juno and transition to Eclipse build facilities</li>
<li>Q1 2013: Initial release</li>
</ul>
